    <h2>Description of meal</h2>
    <p1>Good Food reader Charlotte Hilsdon shares her simple, chocolate chip muffin recipe, to which you can add fruit, chocolate or nuts</p1>
   

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 medium eggs
            </li>
            <li>125ml vegetable oil
            </li> 
            <li>250ml semi-skimmed milk
            </li>
            <li>250g golden caster sugar
            </li>
            <li>400g self-raising flour (or same quantity plain flour and 3 tsp baking powder)
            </li>
            <li>1 tsp salt
            </li>
            <li>100g chocolate chips or dried fruit such as sultanas or dried cherries (optional)
            </li>


        </ul>


    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line 2 muffin trays with paper muffin cases. In a large bowl beat 2 medium eggs lightly with a handheld electric mixer for 1 min.</li>
            <li>Add 125ml vegetable oil and 250ml semi-skimmed milk and beat until just combined then add 250g golden caster sugar and whisk until you have a smooth batter.</li>
            <li>Sift in 400g self-raising flour and 1 tsp salt (or 400g plain flour and 3 tsp baking powder if using) then mix until just smooth. Be careful not to over-mix the batter as this will make the muffins tough.</li>
            <li>Stir in 100g chocolate chips or dried fruit if using.</li>
            <li>Fill muffin cases two-thirds full and bake for 20-25 mins, until risen, firm to the touch and a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean. If the trays will not fit on 1 shelf, swap the shelves around after 15 mins of cooking.

            </li>
            <li>Leave the muffins in the tin to cool for a few mins and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>



        </ol>
